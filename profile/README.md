# 👋 Welcome to the Neurobagel Archive! 🧠🥯

Our goal with the neurobagel project is to provide a way for researchers and
other data users to define and find cohorts of individuals across datasets.
Not all useful and important data can be openly shared
or are allowed to be uploaded to remote servers.
Our approach is to ask data providers to describe their data with metadata,
so that we can let others find out about the data without having direct access to them.

We are building tools with the goal of making the
[annotation](https://github.com/neurobagel/annotation_tool),
integration,
and [searching](https://github.com/neurobagel/concept_query) of these easier.
This project is still relatively young, but we are excited to get this into the
hands of people and hope that it will be useful. The project originated from the [ORIGAMI](https://neurodatascience.github.io/) lab with the [Douglas hospital](https://douglas.research.mcgill.ca/mallar-chakravarty/) and support from many other projects, including [ReproNim](https://www.repronim.org/) and [NeuroHub](https://www.mcgill.ca/hbhl/neurohub).
You can take a look at our current [roadmap](profile/roadmap.md) to see what we are working on.
Come say hello!
